### NZBGET POST-PROCESSING SCRIPT                                          ###

# Sort movies and tv shows.
#
# This is a script for downloaded TV shows and movies. It uses scene-standard
# naming conventions to match TV shows and movies and get the metadata from
# tmdb.org to rename/move/sort/organize them as you like.
#
# The script relies on python library "guessit" (http://guessit.readthedocs.org)
# to extract information from file names and the library "tmdbsimple" to get 
# the metadata from tmdb.org. This script contains code from the nzbget videosort
# script
